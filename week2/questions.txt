cs2521-18x1 Sample Prac Questions Week 2 

Write your functions in the list.c file.

Question 1.
Write a function NodeFromEnd(link l, int k), that takes in a linked list and an integer k
and returns the k'th node from the end of that list. You can assume that k is within the bounds of the
linked list. The very last node of the linked list is at k=0. Bonus imaginary marks for solutions that
only traverse the linked list once.

Question 2.
Write a function that checks whether or not a singly linked list is a palindrome or not.
Do not allocate any space.

Write your test cases in testList.c and compile with:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -o pracwk3 testlist.c list.c
